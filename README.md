# Text Pokemonisator Project

## ðŸ“–Some historical context

Once upon a time, while polish internet was really young, there was something called `Pokemon font`.\
It was a name for writing alternately in upper and lower case letters, like this `pOKeMoniSAtoR`.\
Its name origin is probably from PokÃ©mon logo which is written in such way.

## ðŸŽ¯Project goal

Project goal is to create a simple website that will convert text to this so-called `Pokemon font`.\
My concept is simple design with:
- title,
- input field and submit button,
- output field with converted text.

## ðŸ“ˆProject state

Website design is pretty much done.\
I have to enhance conversion logic.
